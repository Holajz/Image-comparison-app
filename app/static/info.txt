Static files are of two types. First are those files like stylesheets
 to which a page template can just refer to directly. 
 Such files can live in any folder in the app, but are 
 commonly placed within a static folder.

The second type are those that you want to address in code, 
such as when you want to implement an API endpoint that returns a 
static file. For this purpose, the Flask object contains a built-in method, 
send_static_file, which generates a response with a static file contained 
within the app's static folder.
